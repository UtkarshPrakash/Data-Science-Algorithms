# The Sandbox repository

This repo has random work that I wanted to put on GitHub without flooding it with random repositories.

Following are the list of all the work present here:
- **BigQuery**: A notebook to connect to connect and fetch data from bigquery
- **K-Nearest Neighbours**: Code to create k-nearest neighbours model from scratch as well as from sklearn
- **web-scraping**: script to scrap some jobs list from a webpage
- **flex-boxes**: Just a practise ground for learning flexbox in CSS
